            <br>
            <p>I'm Yash Shah. I am a Software Engineer at Motorola Solutions. I like creating backend API's and doing DevOPS tasks.

                Always inquisitive to know 'How IT Work ?', and that's the reason why I am very much interested to build backend. I have a huge interest in Data Since and Machine Learning,
                taking ML courses on deeplearning.ai. A cryptocurrency enthusiast. Apart from coding, I like to travel, long road trips 
                (!timeconstrain ? roadtrip : fly), a gamer by heart - stuck on 'destiny' for a while.
