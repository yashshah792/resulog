            <br>
            <p>I'm Yash Shah, a Software Engineer at <b>Motorola Solutions</b>.
                <br><br>My current role requires working with <b>Common Query</b> and building new <b>query functionalities</b> for existing products.
                <br><br>I like creating backend <b>API’s</b> and performing <b>DevOPS</b> tasks.
                <br><br>Prior to Motorola Solutions, I worked with <b>Atos</b> since July 2016. I worked to build a common cloud platform that can handle and manage multiple cloud platforms from a common place.
                <br><br>I completed my Master’s education from <b>UT Arlington</b> in May 2016 with Majors in Computer Science. I graduated in Bachelor’s degree from <b>Gujarat Technological University</b>, India in June, 2014 with major in Computer Engineering.
                <br><br>
                Always inquisitive to know 'How IT Work ?', and that's the reason why I am very much interested to build backend. I have a huge interest in Data Science and Machine Learning,
                taking ML courses on deeplearning.ai. A cryptocurrency enthusiast. Apart from coding, I like to travel, long road trips 
                (!timeconstrain ? roadtrip : fly), a gamer by heart - stuck on 'destiny' for a while.
