            <br>
            <p>I'm Yash Shah, a Software Engineer at <b>Motorola Solutions</b>.
                <br>I write c#.net and nodejs code to develop backend micro services which empowers Motorola's mission critical softwares.. 
                <br>Prior to Motorola Solutions, I worked with <b>Atos</b> untill September 2017. Here I build a common cloud platform that can handle and manage multiple cloud platforms from a common portal.
                <br><br>I completed my Master’s education from <b>UT Arlington</b> in May 2016 with Majors in Computer Science. I graduated in Bachelor’s degree from <b>Gujarat Technological University</b>, India in June, 2014 with major in Computer Engineering.
                <br><br>
                Always inquisitive to know 'How IT Works ?', and that's the reason I am very much interested to build backends. 
                <br>Apart from coding, I am either sleeping, thinking about interesting things, and consuming various media. I like to travel, long road trips 
                <b>if(!timeconstrain ? roadtrip : fly)</b>, a gamer by heart - stuck on 'Destiny 2' for a while.
